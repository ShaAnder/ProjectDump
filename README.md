## Welcome to my mega project dump!

Over the years of coding and trying out various languages I have accured a wealth of experience in different programming disciplines and formats, 
rather than just leave these floating around I felt I had to give them a home in their own repo. This is a linker repo, It serves solely to be
pinned onto the mainpage of my github for anyone looking to see what I have made and what I can do.

SO to navigate to these various projects and repos simply click below! This will take you to the language linker of your choice, which will then 
showcase what i've made in that language!
